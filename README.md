# Random Pairs

assenment:
continue with out random pair app we now want to be able to change the number of input boxes. So instead of hard coding a number into an input box we want a button that will create a new box each time we press it. We want to pass all of the inputs as an array to the app rb. Next pass these names into your method that you already have. Set the return to a variable that you can now pass into your results page.(This should be data type array.) Now inside of your view iterate over your array and populate a check box with these names.  We want to be able to check pairs that we feel work well together so have a check box beside all of the random pairs. After i select one or more pairs i want to post these back to a route and then show  the selected pairs on another page.
